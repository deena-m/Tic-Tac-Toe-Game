# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
Tic-Tac-Toe with Timer is a Python-based desktop game built using the tkinter library. It enhances the traditional Tic-Tac-Toe experience by introducing a move timer, color-coded players, winning cell highlights, and a reset/play again menu, making it both interactive and visually appealing.
